% The testflow support page is at:
% http://www.michaelshell.org/tex/testflow/



% Note that the a4paper option is mainly intended so that authors in
% countries using A4 can easily print to A4 and see how their papers will
% look in print - the typesetting of the document will not typically be
% affected with changes in paper size (but the bottom and side margins will).
% Use the testflow package mentioned above to verify correct handling of
% both paper sizes by the user's LaTeX system.
%
% Also note that the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", option
% should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be displayed in
% draft mode.
%
\documentclass[10pt, conference, compsocconf]{IEEEtran}
% Add the compsocconf option for Computer Society conferences.
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[conference]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\begin{abstract}
In the last decade, there has been a tendency to integrate tools directly into
the software development environment. This approach is particularly
interesting because it reduces the effort spent switching over between tools,
which makes the process of collaboration and development more seamless. For
developers, this means that they can communicate and coordinate their work
through the same tools they use to develop code. However, with the increasing
avalability of such tools, the problem of overloading the software enviroment
arises--only some decorators, views, and notations can be inserted, seen or 
active at a time. This type of atomistic approach is clearly undesirable, 
distracting from work and detracting from the overall effectiveness of a more 
holistic development environment. To overcome this challenge, we introduce 
Lighthouse, a novel collaboration platform that unifies previously 
disparate collaboration functionalities together into a single location. 
This paper presents the state of the art of Lighthouse and shows three examples 
of extensions using the Lighthouse infrastructure.

\section{Introduction}
Software development is a collaborative process, where developers need to
work together in order to understand the problem, make decisions and coordinate
their work. In their daily activities, in addition to face-to-face interaction,
developers use collaborative tools that can exist as an external application
(e.g. email, instant messaging) or as an embedded plug-in into the software
development environment (e.g. version control and issue tracking systems)
\cite{Cheng:2003}. These collaboration tools are essential in supporting both communication
and coordination of work, especially in situations where the development teams
have become increasingly dispersed, such as in open-source and
off-shore development \cite{Cheng:2003}.

In the last decade, there has been a tendency to integrate these
collaborative tools directly into the software development environment. The idea
is to reduce the effort spent switching over between tools, which makes the
process of collaboration and development more seamless
\cite{Booch:2003}. For developers, this means that they can
communicate and coordinate their work through the same tools they use to develop code.

%since developers often want to have these tools ready-at-hand
%of collaboration tools integrated to the software development enviroment

% Mylyn \cite{mylyn}, Palant\'{i}r \cite{palantir}, and Expertise Browser
% \cite{expertise-browser} are good examples of tools integrated to the software
% development enviroment. All of them make the process of collaboration more
% attractive by providing information about the context of the software being
% built to the developing team. 

The Eclipse platform is an important starting point
for the foundation of an integrated collaborative software
development environment \cite{Cheng:2003}. This platform has frameworks and
extensions points that simplify the process of integration between Eclipse and third-party tools, which make it very appealing for developers to contribute
their own add-ons. For instance, Mylyn \cite{mylyn}, Palant\'{i}r
\cite{palantir}, and Expertise Browser \cite{expertise-browser} are third-party
tools that make the process of collaboration more attractive by providing
information about the context of the software being built to the developing
team. In addition, Eclipse Marketplace \cite{eclipse-marketplace} has made
thousands of tools for Eclipse available online, which makes Eclipse a good
choice as a development environment for developers.

However, with more and more such tools, the problem of overloading the software
development environment arises--only some decorators, views, and notations
can be inserted, seen or active at a time. Moreover, it spreads out related
information functionality through out the software development environment, thus
not fostering a condition in which the various tools’ can work together to
synthesize and visually group the different yet interrelated properties of the project.
This type of atomistic approach is clearly undesirable, distracting from work
and detracting from the overall effectiveness of a more holistic development
environment. 

To overcome this challenge, we use two simultaneous strategies.
First, a proper configuration of the development environment with multiple monitors to
increase the screen real estate and clearly divide the purpose and types of 
tools that are placed in each screen. Second, a platform that provides an
architectural and visual foundation in which future collaborative tools can be
built upon.

This paper introduces Lighthouse, a novel collaboration platform
that unifies previously disparate collaboration functionalities together
into a single location \cite{Chen:2006}. This single location emerges as a side
by side display where code and coordination activities appear as
discrete entities presented simultaneously. This strategy, which presents
a variety of collaborative information in conjunction with the task of coding,
frees developers from the burden of switching between views; it also improves
the ability of developers to multitask, which is a central component of any
development environment. Rather than being forced to look in multiple places
for different development needs, developers can utilize  Lighthouse while coding
to gain an uninterrupted understanding of the collaborative activities that are
taking place in the project.  As a lighthouse warns ships of the dangers of
approaching shallow water, Lighthouse aids developers in much the same
manner--enabling awareness of a given environment and, with it, the interactive
capacity to respond to new challenges and adapt the software to create new solutions.

The Lighthouse collaborative platform exhibits four distinct features:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item It separates code from the collaboration functionalities through a
  side-by-side view;  
  \item It builds on Emerging Design, so all the collaboration functionality is
  anchored to a visual representation of the code;
  \item It provides a fine-grain information model--all events
  associated with source code changes are tracked and available to developers;  
  \item It utilizes an extensible infrastructure, so new
  functionality can be easily added on top of the platform.
\end{enumerate}

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we introduce
the Emerging Design concept. Section 3 describes the approach, particularly
introducing the four key design decisions behind Lighthouse. Section 4 shows how
Lighthouse is extended. Section 5 shows three examples of extensions using
the Lighthouse infrastructure. Section 6 addresses related works and concluding
remarks are presented in Section 7.

% All aspects of the coordination 
% functionalities are displayed in a separate view, side by side
% 
% By choosing to focus on programming or on
% coordination activities as needed, developers maintain greater control over
% their environment and
% 
% by doing this, Lighthouse prevents the IDE from being overloaded and separate
% out the coordination and collaboration functionalities into a separate space.
% 
% Lighthouse unifies coordination
% activities.  Developers can focus on programming or coor

% In this paper we introduce Lighthouse, a novel collaboration platform
% that brings together formerly separate tools into a single location.


%talk about the extra monitor
% This paper introduces Ligthouse, a novel collaboration platform that brings
% together these formerly separate tools into a single location.
% Rather than being forced to look in multiple places for different development
% needs, Lighthouse unifies coordinates activities.  Developers can focus on
% programming or coor

% Lighthouse unifies previously disparate coordination functionalities together
% into a single visualization \cite{Chen:2006}., providing a shared understanding
% concerning the state of the software artifacts and the activities that are taking place on the project. While doing this, we prevent the IDE for
% being overloaded and separate out all the coordination functionalities into a
% different environment. In Lighthouse, we gather all the fine-grained real-time
% information regarding the emerging state of the project into a complementary
% display,  and provide an architectural and visual foundation upon which future
% collaborative tools can build on.



% Developers using the tool perspective

%The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

% However, with more and more such tools, the problem of overloading the software
% development environment arises – only some decorators, views, etc. can be
% inserted, seem or active at a time before the coding area becomes overloaded.
% Moreover, it spreads out related info functionality etc. through out the IDE
% (different related stuff that should be much close declared). This is clearly 
% undesirable, distracting from work and is not as effective as how it should be.

% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command, the
% \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil must be used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% The subfigure.sty package works much the same way, except \subfigure is
% used instead of \subfloat.

%\begin{figure*}[!t]
%\centerline{\subfloat[Case I]\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{subfigcase1}%
%\label{fig_first_case}}
%\hfil
%\subfloat[Case II]{\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{subfigcase2}%
%\label{fig_second_case}}}
%\caption{Simulation results}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure*}
%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the 
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table. Table text will default to
% \footnotesize as IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.
%
%\begin{table}[!t]
%% increase table row spacing, adjust to taste
%\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
% if using array.sty, it might be a good idea to tweak the value of
% \extrarowheight as needed to properly center the text within the cells

%\centering
%% Some packages, such as MDW tools, offer better commands for making tables
%% than the plain LaTeX2e tabular which is used here.
%\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}
%\hline
%One & Two\\
%\hline
%Three & Four\\
%\hline
%\end{tabular}
%\end{table}


% Note that IEEE does not put floats in the very first column - or typically
% anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also, in-text middle ("here")
% positioning is not used. Most IEEE journals/conferences use top floats
% exclusively. Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the \fnbelowfloat
% command of the stfloats package.
