The StatSVN Team and ObjectLab are proud to announce v0.2.0 of StatSVN

If you want to know what happened in your Subversion repository,
this is the tool for you!

StatSVN retrieves information from a Subversion repository and generates
various tables and charts describing the project evolution, e.g.
the lines of code over time, contribution of each developer, the
evolution of modules, directories, files, the time and days when most
checkins happen, etc. It also shows the commit logs and integrates 
out of the box with ViewVc, BugZilla, Chora and others.

The current version of StatSVN generates a static suite of HTML or XDoc
documents containing tables and chart images. 

The new XDoc support enables a basic level of integration of the stats
in a maven build.  This is demonstrated on the following page:
http://www.statsvn.org/statsvn

StatSVN is available now for download at http://www.statsvn.org

StatSVN is open source software, released under the terms of the LGPL,
based on StatCVS, it uses JFreeChart to generate charts.
