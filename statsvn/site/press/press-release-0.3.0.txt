The StatSVN Team and ObjectLab are proud to announce v0.3.0 of StatSVN

If you want to know what happened in your Subversion repository,
this is the tool for you!

StatSVN retrieves information from a Subversion repository and generates
various tables and charts describing the project evolution, e.g.
the lines of code over time, contribution of each developer, the
evolution of modules, directories, files, the time and days when most
checkins happen, etc. It also shows the commit logs and integrates 
out of the box with ViewVc, BugZilla, Chora and others.

The new version of StatSVN generates a static suite of HTML or XDoc
documents containing tables and chart images.

Version 0.3.0 includes, amongst others:
---------------------------------------

- New Line of Code and 'Churn' page that shows the evolution of LOC and
  the number of lines touched. This gives a sense of the kind of activity
  (new lines or re-working existing lines)
- New and dynamic repo based on JTreeMap that at a glance, shows the
  last 30 days of changes in your repo. It is possible to drill down and
  is very visual (based on an applet that requires jdk 5 jre).
- Fetching the line diff is now multi-threaded (25) by default if a call
  to the server takes more than 2 seconds. Both threshold and threads
  are configurable
- Added 'experimental' support for SymbolicLinks (tags).
- Based on StatCVS 0.3 (plus one fix for ViewVC with Ant).
- A number of fixes and improvements.

The new XDoc support enables a basic level of integration of the stats
in a maven build.  This is demonstrated on the following page:

StatSVN is available now for download at http://www.statsvn.org

StatSVN is open source software, released under the terms of the LGPL,
based on StatCVS, it uses JFreeChart and JTreeMap to generate charts.
